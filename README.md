## 2010 World Population Data Visualization in Python 

This project is a Python script that uses **Matplotlib**, **Pygal library**, and **JSON**.

This project is currently not working due to some deprecations with updated Pygal library. I am currently trying to update this script.

## How does this project work?

This project pulls country data from a JSON file to organize the data and plot it with Pygal.

The world map itself is made with Pygal.

Population data is sorted and colored per population density.

Hovering over each country tells you its population range and total population.
